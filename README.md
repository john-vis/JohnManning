With 25+ years of IT career in the books so far this is an interesting exersize for me.  My very first "paid" job was to transpose code from an IBM compatible to an Apple IIe that ran a math quiz for students.  My payment was a thank you card from the teacher and I was in 5th grade at the time.

I moved from coding to infrastructure work early in my career and it has now brought me around to cloud hosting in Azure.  I am finding that dusting off the old coding and scripting I've used in the past will be a real benifit to operations going forward.  At this time I'm keeping repo's private for security reasons.
